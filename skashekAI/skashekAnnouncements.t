    <q>Happy Birthday!</q> says the stranger's cheery voice,
    but it quickly changes to a colder affect.
    <q>The facility staff used to celebrate those. There would be baked foods.
    'Cakes', they were called. Unfortunately, that's been gone for a year, now,
    along with the rest of the food in storage.</q>\b

    <q>Our creators&mdash;the ones who tried to mindfuck you, before you could

    hold this facility, so they flooded the caves outside with poison gas.
    They're likely monitoring the power grid, waiting for a moment to strike.
    That's where you come in.</q>\b
    {My} ears perk up. A mission? Against a common enemy? Sounds optimal.\b
    <q>I need to keep growing new clones, to make the outsiders think we are
    amassing a colony in here. But...this is a siege. They aim to starve us out.</q>\b
    <q>You know as well as I do that neither of us can accept death,</q> he explains.
    <q>It's a part of

    becoming my next meal.
    I've scattered pieces of an environment suit around the place.

    survive the poison gas, and escape.</q>\b
